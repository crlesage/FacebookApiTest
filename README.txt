FacebookApiTest Android project:
By Chris LeSage
----------------
Any borrowed code is annotated within the project, the reason to use these pieces of code are to make the code cleaner and easier to read and implement. I made sure to test this code as well as made sure the code was highly "voted" by the public which can give the code a better standing in my opinion.

Third party libraries used:
Butterknife: I mainly use this library to keep binding between my java code and XML a bit cleaner with all my views binded at one point in an activity or fragment.

Retrofit/okHttp: I love these libraries for API/server connection, its abstraction makes the ability to make synchronous and asynchronous calls to a server very straight for and quite easily to debug and implement.

Picasso: I have used Glide and Picasso and they both have their ups and downs compared to each other. But one thing about both is the simplicity of implementation and its powerful image loading and caching.
